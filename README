This small project is all about creating a single .deb file.
The debian file does pretty much what is being described here:

http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/logging.html#Using_Log4j

in other words once installed into a Debian or Ubuntu setup,
it will replace the default Tomcat logging with log4j logging,
which is a rotating log.

In detail, it has a script that does following:

1. downloads a couple of JAR files from apache web site
2. creates log4j properties file
3. creates a .deb dile
